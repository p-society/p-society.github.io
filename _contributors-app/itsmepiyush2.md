 - I enjoy handling data and discovering correlations between seemingly unrelated features. I have a knack for economics, statistics and data science and I am interested in artificial intelligence. I have done quite a few projects pertaining to data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence.

 - Besides the technical side of things, I am fond of content writing and debating. I have participated in many national level debates like the Raja Rammohan Roy Academy Debate, Dehra Dun. I have also been an adjudicator in a parliamentary debate held in SOA Law College, Bhubaneshwar. Moreover, I have a senior diploma in Classical Tabla (Delhi school) and Hindustani Classical Vocal Music (Gwalior school).
