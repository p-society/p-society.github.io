volunteer_experience: |
 - I enjoy handling data and discovering correlations between seemingly unrelated features. I have a knack for economics, statistics and Data Science and I am interested in Artificial Intelligence. I have done quite a few projects pertaining to Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

 - Besides the technical side of things, I am fond of content writing, proofreading and debating. I have participated in many national level debates like the Raja Rammohan Roy Academy Debate, Dehra Dun. I have also been an adjudicator in a parliamentary debate held in SOA Law College, Bhubaneshwar. Moreover, I have a senior diploma in Classical Tabla (Delhi school) and Hindustani Classical Vocal Music (Gwalior school).
