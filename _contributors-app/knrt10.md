### My feelings that needed sharing (Most won't give a 🖕🏼 and I don't care)

हेलो फ़्रेंड्ज़।
में कुछ अपने पर्सनल experience को share कर रहा हूँ अभी।
यहाँ पर में एकदम freely boluinga जैसा में फ़ील करता हूँ।

I didn’t believe in friends utill I met 2 dudes of my life. For some security reason I won’t be mentioning their names. Truth is everyone is there for some part of your life cause it’s their need or yours to be with them. I won’t say that I am a saint, I do the same but I don’t fake anything. I say what’s the truth.

So one of my dude made a huge impact in life. He taught me most of the things that I am capable of today, its mostly because of him. He has been an amazing person to me either as a friend or as a mentor. He is one of the 2 person that I won’t want to loose as long as I can hold him with me. He is pro1.

Second person that made a huge impact is literally a kid. I consider him friend cause we share some good things(I would say all) and he is a real good friend. Sometimes he can be real shit about it but at the end of the day I would say he is mah pro2. I am quite fascinated by him.

So other than these two I don’t give a fuck about anyone else. And it’s reality but you don’t have friends. Nobody has, its just a phase of your life and you would forget about them when you leave them. But I don’t want this to happen with mah 2 dudes and would like to contradict my theory.

✌🏼 out. I’m pro.
