work_experience: |
  - Google Summer of Code Student @[TheJuliaLanguage](https://julialang.org/): Worked on Machine Learning models in Julia. Main targets of the project include implementing ONNX backend for the Flux framework, implementing models for performing Computer Vision based tasks in Julia. [May 2018 - Present]

  - Developer @[Julia](https://julialang.org/): Worked on various packages in Julia, such as Flux.jl, ONNX.jl, Metalhead.jl. Most of them focued on Computer Vision.

  - Developer @[Coala](https://github.com/orgs/coala/teams/coala-developers): Solved pending issues in a few coala projects. [August 2017 - Present]

  - Contributor @[SymPy](https://github.com/sympy): Started my journey in Open Source by contributing to SymPy. Mainly focused on the Geometry module for Sympy. [Jun 2017 - Present]

project:
- |
    - [Image Caption Generator](): A tool to generate captions from Images. Tech Stack: Python, Deep Learning, Vision, NLP. Soon to be open sourced.
- |
    - [Kaggle Datasets](): I'm pretty active on Kaggle. I love playing around with different datasets.

volunteer_experience: |
  - I spend most of my time reading about AI. On other days, I contribute to Open Source organizations.

  - I've have taken a few introductory session on Pythons and Open Source technologies.

  - I am a member of the Programming Society IIIT-Bh. Together we try to guide the first years in getting started with software development.
